# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-ML-API
End to End ML project with Flask API deployment

Collected and analyzed medical insurance dataset to understand relationships between age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and insurance cost.

Performed data preprocessing & encoding to convert categorical features (sex, smoker, region) into numerical format for machine learning compatibility.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to fairly evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.

Trained a Linear Regression machine learning model to predict medical insurance cost based on multiple input features.

Evaluated the model using R² score and error metrics to measure prediction accuracy and model reliability.

Saved the trained ML model using pickle for reuse in real-time prediction systems without retraining.

Built a REST API using Flask to expose the ML model as a web service for real-world usage.

Tested the API locally and validated predictions to ensure correct functioning before deployment.

Version controlled the complete project using Git to track changes, maintain history, and follow professional development workflow.

Hosted the full project on GitHub to showcase an industry-ready ML project with analysis, training, and deployment code.
